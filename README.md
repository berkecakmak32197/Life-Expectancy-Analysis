# Life Expectancy and Air Quality Analysis

## **Project Overview**
Over the next three months, this project will investigate how air quality impacts life expectancy across different countries. By analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) values alongside life expectancy metrics, I aim to uncover which environmental factors have the most significant influence on human lifespan. Using data visualization, statistical methods, and machine learning techniques, I will explore correlations and test hypotheses to derive meaningful insights.

The plan is straightforward: merge life expectancy data with air quality data, analyze the relationships, and build predictive models to estimate life expectancy based on pollution levels. Ultimately, this project aims to highlight the importance of clean air and its direct impact on human health and longevity.

## **Objectives**

### **Understand Environmental Influences**
- Explore the relationship between air quality, GDP, healthcare factors, and life expectancy.

### **Identify Key Factors**
- Pinpoint which variables have the strongest impact on life expectancy across different countries.

### **Data-Driven Policy Recommendations**
- Use insights from the analysis to suggest actionable strategies for improving public health and air quality.

### **Apply Data Science Skills**
- Implement data science concepts learned in DSA 210, including data preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques.

## **Motivation**
This project combines two significant areas of interest: public health and data science. Here’s why it matters:

### **Health Impact**
Air pollution is a leading environmental risk that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding how it influences life expectancy can drive better policies and interventions.

### **Scientific Approach**
Rather than relying on assumptions, this project takes a data-driven approach to analyzing the effects of air quality on human lifespan.

### **Practical Application**
It’s an opportunity to apply the theoretical knowledge gained in class to a real-world public health issue.

### **Long-Term Insights**
Findings from this study could contribute to broader discussions on climate change, urban planning, and healthcare policies.

## **Dataset**
The dataset for this project consists of country-level data on life expectancy and air quality. Here’s what will be analyzed:

- **Country**: Name of the country
- **Year**: The specific year for the recorded data
- **Life Expectancy**: Average life expectancy in years
- **Adult Mortality**: Probability of dying between 15-60 years per 1,000 population
- **Infant Deaths**: Number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births
- **Healthcare Factors**: Data on immunization rates, schooling, and healthcare access
- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product per capita
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Measurement of pollution levels in various countries
- **AQI Status**: Classification of air quality (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy)

The data will be cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and inconsistencies. Outliers will be identified and managed to ensure accurate analysis. This dataset provides a solid foundation for exploring the impact of environmental conditions on human lifespan.

Hypotheses

In this project, we aim to explore the relationship between air quality and life expectancy across different countries. The following hypotheses are investigated:
	•	Null Hypothesis (H₀):
There is no statistically significant relationship between air quality (as measured by the Air Quality Index, AQI) and life expectancy. Variations in AQI do not meaningfully impact the average life expectancy across countries.
	•	Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
There is a statistically significant relationship between air quality and life expectancy. Specifically:
	•	H₁a: Higher AQI values (worse air quality) are associated with lower life expectancy.
	•	H₁b: Lower AQI values (better air quality) are associated with higher life expectancy.
	•	H₁c: After controlling for economic and healthcare-related variables, air quality remains a significant predictor of life expectancy.

Through statistical analysis and modeling, we seek to either reject the null hypothesis or provide evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis.
